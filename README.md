## Projects
### JoyBot (Python)
- JoyBot was my first large Discord bot, containing:
  - Legacy text-based commands
  - A spawn and collection system
    - Users spawn and collect a variety of over 300 unique spawns <br>
    ![Detailed collection command](https://github.com/hi-joy-nz/hi-joy-nz/blob/main/Examples/JoyBot%20examples/Detailed%20spawn%20collection.png)
    - Users can race to find 'Challenge Spawns' - a randomly selected spawn that rewards users with 'Challenge Points' when found <br>
    ![Challenge spawns and points](https://github.com/hi-joy-nz/hi-joy-nz/blob/main/Examples/JoyBot%20examples/Challenge%20spawns%20and%20points.png)
  - A truth or dare game
  - A fun fact command
  - A fishing command
  - A "who is most likely to" question command
  - A channel slowmode adjustment command 
- JoyBot is hosted on my Raspberry Pi, and is currently used actively in a private server of nearly 50 members with frequent updates
- JoyBot is made with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

See [more examples](https://github.com/hi-joy-nz/hi-joy-nz/tree/main/Examples/JoyBot%20examples) of JoyBot being used

### SafeBot (Python)

**[Read SafeBot's documentation](https://hi-joy-nz.github.io/hi-joy-nz/SafeBot/Documentation)**
- SafeBot is my first attempt to make a complete multipurpose Discord bot that uses [slash-commands](https://discord.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-discord-apps?ref=badge), and is far more advanced than JoyBot, containing:
  - A complete slash command and embed system
  - Error handling for all commands with developer logs for unexpected errors
  - A currency system
    - Users can earn and spend a currency from a balance stored in an external file
    - (Work in progress) Store and purchasing system with real-time store updates, with all store information managed with an external JSON file <br>
  ![Balance command](https://github.com/hi-joy-nz/hi-joy-nz/blob/main/Examples/SafeBot%20Examples/Points%20balance.png)
  - A complete ticketing system
    - Users can create a private channel with staff, and are able to add extra users into the ticket
  - Pokémon collecting game
    - Every 2 minutes, users can spawn a random Pokémon
      - Pokémon are spawned based on the area the user selected, and the rarity of the Pokémon
      - All Pokémon have a small chance to be [shiny](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shiny_Pok%C3%A9mon), which is influenced by their rarity; with rarer Pokémon having a higher chance to be shiny <br>
  ![Example encounter](https://github.com/hi-joy-nz/hi-joy-nz/blob/main/Examples/SafeBot%20Examples/Pokemon%20spawn%20(city).png)
    - Users can view their collection <br>
    ![Collection](https://github.com/hi-joy-nz/hi-joy-nz/blob/main/Examples/SafeBot%20Examples/Pokemon%20collection%20(page%201).png)
      - They can also apply certain filters <br>
      ![Collection with shiny filter](https://github.com/hi-joy-nz/hi-joy-nz/blob/main/Examples/SafeBot%20Examples/Pokemon%20collection%20(shiny).png)
    - Users can view the Pokémon that spawn in a specified area, sorted by rarity <br>
    ![Spawns in volcano area](https://github.com/hi-joy-nz/hi-joy-nz/blob/main/Examples/SafeBot%20Examples/Pokemon%20spawns%20(volcano).png)
    - Users can view details about a Pokémon they have caught <br>
    ![Info panel](https://github.com/hi-joy-nz/hi-joy-nz/blob/main/Examples/SafeBot%20Examples/Pokemon%20info%20(1).png)
  - An about user command
    - Gets and displays data about a provided user from the Discord API <br>
    ![About command](https://github.com/hi-joy-nz/hi-joy-nz/blob/main/Examples/SafeBot%20Examples/About%20user.png)
  - A Spotify search command
    - Searches Spotify's API for a term and provides details about the top result <br>
